summary: Toward the modelling of the cavitation phenomenon in spacecraft turbopumps

abstract: "The modelling of cavitation within turbopumps requires a two-phase flow model able to capture the phase change phenomenon and reproduce the flow behavior in a rotating geometry. To this end the compressible pressure-velocity equilibrium model from the diffuse interface method is used. The specific developments of this model in the context of turbopumps are shown and some preliminary results are given."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [_Slides_](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
