              Simulation of multiphase flows within spacecraft turbopumps under the supervision of Eric Daniel and Fabien Petitpas.
              Topics of work include:

              * Contribution to the development in C/C++ of compressible single-phase/two-phase flow models in the open-source computationnal software [ECOGEN](https://code-mphi.github.io/ECOGEN/). ([article](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03387818))
              * Management of GitLab/[GitHub](https://github.com/code-mphi/ECOGEN) team repositories.
              * Setup and management of team HPC servers (Open-MPI, Slurm, disk-quota).
              * Simulation of the cavitation phenomenon within turbopumps using diffuse interface two-phase flow models ([thesis](https://www.theses.fr/2022AIXM0360)).
              * Adaptation of a two-phase flow model in mechanical equilibrium to take into account the movement of pump blades using the moving reference frame method. ([article](https://doi.org/10.1115/GT2022-78025))
              * Teaching of phase change and computationnal fluid dynamics at the Polytech Marseille engineering school.
