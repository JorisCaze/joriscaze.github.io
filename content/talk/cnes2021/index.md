summary: Toward the modelling of the cavitation phenomenon in spacecraft turbopumps
abstract: "The modelling of cavitation within turbopumps requires a two-phase flow model able to capture the phase change phenomenon and reproduce the flow behavior in a rotating geometry. To this end the compressible pressure-velocity equilibrium model from the diffuse interface method is used. The specific developments of this model in the context of turbopumps are shown and some preliminary results are given."
