# Overview 
Personnal website hosted with [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) available at https://joriscaze.github.io/

Static website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static website generator and the formely *Academic* theme now replaced by [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/).

For the sake of simplicity I use the *Academic* theme without the CMS offered by wowchemy, see setup below.

# Memento to update website

Clone the repository locally

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/JorisCaze/joriscaze.github.io.git
```

To edit the content simply edit the desired markdown file in the *content/* folder.

Once done, you can check your website locally

```sh
$ hugo server
```

Finally, the final is built under the *public/* folder with the following command

```sh
$ hugo
```

Since the website is hosted on GitHub pages, the folder must be named *docs* to be automatically deployed by GitHub.
Therefore, rename the folder

```sh
$ mv public docs
```

Commit and push changes to remote to update the web version.

# Install Hugo, Academic theme and dependencies

Install Hugo and dependencies required by the Academic theme:

```sh
brew install hugo golang node
```

Since I do not want to use the Wowchemy CMS builder, the template is downloaded directly and updated according to my needs.
The template was originally downloaded from the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic).

For more information, see the official [documentation](https://wowchemy.com/docs/getting-started/install-hugo-extended/).

# Hosting 

Since the website generated by the Hugo framework is static, it can be hosted directly with a free static hosting provider. 
In my case I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with a *user site*.

The website can be hosted directly using a GitHub repository named either:
- `username.github.io` for a *user site* which will be accessible at the address `username.github.io`.
- `repo` for a *project site* which will be accessible at the address `username.github.io/repo`.

Once the repo created, its settings must be updated to indicate to GitHub to host the website.
Go to *Settings -> Pages* and set *Deploy from branch* using a build folder named *docs/*.
